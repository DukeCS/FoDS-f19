    "The British Royal Air Force wanted to know how many warplanes the Germans had (some number `N`, which is a *population parameter*), and they needed to estimate that quantity knowing only a random sample of the planes' serial numbers (from 1 to `N`). We know that the German's warplanes are labeled consecutively from 1 to `N`, so `N` would be the total number of warplanes they have. \n",

    "We normally investigate the random variation amongst our estimates by simulating a sampling procedure from the population many times and computing estimates from each sample that we generate.  In real life, if the RAF had known what the population looked like, they would have known `N` and would not have had any reason to think about random sampling. However, they didn't know what the population looked like, so they couldn't have run the simulations that we normally do.  \n",

Given *just* a random sample of serial numbers, we'll estimate `N`, and then we'll use simulation to find out how accurate our estimate probably is, without ever looking at the whole population.
